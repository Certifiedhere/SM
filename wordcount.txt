MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique used for distributed computing based on key-value pairs. It was introduced by Google and allows for the processing of large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster of computers. The MapReduce model consists of two main steps: the Map step, which processes input data and generates intermediate key-value pairs, and the Reduce step, which processes the intermediate data to produce the final output.
